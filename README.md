# Welcome to the base-of-operations for my portfolio website

This repository contains the code for my portfolio website. The original html, css, and php were acquired from a free Colorlib theme and then further edited from the legend harrisonjanisma himself. His code can be found <a href="https://github.com/harrisonjansma/harrisonjansma.github.io">here</a> and the template can be found <a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/template/personal/">here</a>. As it was for Harrison, it was also a lot of fun tweaking the HTML to make it my own. Although I had some previous expereince with HTML and CSS in the past, it was love at first sight with this template. Thanks again, Harrison!

## Things I learned:
#### 1. Basic HTML and CSS manipulation. 
Simply knowing that HTML was for editing content and CSS for editing the style of that content made this website all the more appealing to pick up as a project.
Little tip: editing these kinds of files in Notepad++ is very easy and helped me with organizing all my code.

#### 2. Basic (& free) backend setup and deployment.
I created and deployed this website using GitHub Pages so I could learn more about web app design, back-end development, and site hosting.
